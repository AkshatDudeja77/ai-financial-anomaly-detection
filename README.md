# AI-Powered Financial Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
This project implements an AI-driven system to detect anomalous financial transactions using unsupervised machine learning. It is designed to simulate how modern financial institutions monitor transaction risk beyond static, rule-based systems.

## Business Context
Traditional fraud detection systems rely heavily on predefined rules, which often fail to capture subtle or evolving risk patterns. This project demonstrates how anomaly detection can enhance financial risk monitoring and reduce false positives.

## Technical Approach
- Used Python to preprocess and analyze transaction data
- Implemented Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection
- Identified abnormal transaction behavior based on feature distributions
- Generated interpretable outputs for downstream reporting

## Cloud Architecture Alignment
The system is designed to be cloud-ready and aligns with AWS concepts:
- Amazon S3 for data storage
- EC2 or AWS Lambda for model execution
- Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting
- Analytics outputs suitable for visualization dashboards

## Outputs
- Flagged anomalous transactions
- Time-based risk patterns for monitoring
- Data suitable for executive dashboards and reporting

## Skills Demonstrated
Python, Machine Learning, Anomaly Detection, Financial Risk Analysis, AWS Architecture Concepts, Data Analytics
